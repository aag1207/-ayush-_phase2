# 1. IQ Test

let your input x = 30478191278.

wrap your answer with nite{ } for the flag.

As an example, entering x = 34359738368 gives (y0, ..., y11), so the flag would be nite{010000000011}.

## Solution:

To solve this challenge, I first had to convert 30478191278 into binary to solve the logic gates. I got 35 digits, 11100011001100110010000101101101110. I then input these values and got 11 y values, 10001111000.

## Flag:

```
nite{10001111000}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I have learnt the concept of logic gates.
