# 1. GDB Baby step 1

Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.
Disassemble this.

## Solution:

I understood here that we had to disassemble a file. I then installed IDA which is a file disassembler, and disassembled the file to get the following output. I then used the second clue and obtained a hexadecimal input 86342 and converted it to decimal which is 549698.
